I have decided to take up projects in the Robotics Club for summer due to my immense intersest
in the field of Robitics, I am passionate about the hardware as well as the software aspects of it.

I have particularly chosen the project for 'AUTONOMOUS NAVIGATION OF MARS ROVER' as my first preference
due to my interest in areas such as Machine Learning and Computer Vision.
I also have a keen interest in learning ROS and its application in various domains.

I am also thilled about the 'GYROBOT: SELF-BALANCING ROBOT' project offered by the robotics club.
I am interseted in this project due to it including implementaion of PID and also focucusing on the
aspect of PCB design and and hardware designing using CAD.
